# EventStream Benchmark (WIP)

The project provides a toolkit for creating **synthetic event steram** with controllable structure, randomness, and temporal behavior.


It can be used for benchmarking sequence-learning systems that are expected to operate in *real time*, learning sequences *lifelong* and *online*.

However, the repository is not yet ready for practical research use.
It is still in an experimental and exploratory stage, and its interfaces, data formats, and algorithms may change significantly as development continues.
